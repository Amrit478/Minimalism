# Minimalism

This is build based on the Minimalism. In this project a user can check what things he needs to live his life as a minimalsit. I will provide that and use mysql as database and java 8 and spring framework for backend. I will devlop this using micro services arttiecure and I will use docker to contanirize the services and upload it using kubernetes for cloud.
